# Files marked with "export-ignore" are excluded from Composer package archives.
# This ensures only production-ready code is shipped to users when installed via Composer,
# while keeping development, CI, tests, and documentation inside the Git repository.
#
# Composer uses `git archive` to build release ZIPs, which honors these rules.
# Do NOT remove unless you want all dev files to be distributed to end users.
